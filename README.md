# Pima Alarm API

## Description
This API is designed to work with the Pima alarm system.
It's designed to work with systems that use the old app (iPima) which connects directly to the system,
unlike the new app which connects through the cloud.

## Note
In my experience the remote connection feature is not reliable and most of the time doesn't work.

## Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Guy293/PimaAPI
cd PimaAPI
pip install ./PimaAPI
```
